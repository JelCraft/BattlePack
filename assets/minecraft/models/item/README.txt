Link shield â†’ round_shield_blocking (Don't think I can rename shield to "round_shield", as mc won't know which .json to grab, other one should be fine as it's linked within the first.)

shield_default contains the default model for the shield, linking to shield_blocking (which should be changed to round_shield_blocking, in our case).
